Short term contract with Havik, a company that develops VR military simulation software. Delivered redesign and refactor of the UI/UX for Havik’s virtual reality military simulation, Joint Fires, built with the Unity Engine. This included implementing a new user profile system, which included the user’s AJACTS training status. I also implemented a post-simulation session review feature for the instructor and student, as well as creating all visual elements and UI layouts. These features were implemented using the MVC design pattern. Implemented a new UI layout and features for the Havik Voice application. These features include creating a dynamic visual waveform that displays when any user speaks. Other frontend features implemented include those commonly found in voice chat applications, such as, mute/unmute, volume control, channel selection, and connect/disconnect.

## Personal Projects

### Redis Server Database and Client
Developed a Redis-like in-memory data store in modern C++ (C++17), featuring RESP protocol support for compatibility with redis-cli. Implemented core data structures (strings, lists, hashes) with thread-safe operations and periodic background persistence to a dump file. Designed a multithreaded TCP server supporting concurrent client connections and graceful shutdown with final state saving. Built a cross-platform Redis client capable of connecting to a Redis server over TCP, constructing RESP commands, and parsing server responses. Implemented portable socket handling for Windows (Winsock2) and Linux (POSIX), with a CLI scaffold ready for interactive command execution. This project demonstrates utilization of systems programming, networking, multithreading, and protocol design skills.


### Unix Shell in C
Developed a custom Unix-like shell in C with an interactive prompt, command parsing, and built-in commands (cd, pwd, echo, env, which, exit). Implemented input handling via getline(), tokenization with dynamic memory management, and clean resource deallocation each iteration. Added external command execution using PATH lookup to run common system utilities. Enhanced usability with error messages for invalid commands and improved built-in behavior. This project demonstrates utilization in low-level C programming, process control, and memory management.


### Torres Shark (Network Packet Sniffer)
Developed a Windows-focused network packet sniffer with a Tkinter-based GUI for capturing and inspecting IPv4 traffic. Implemented raw socket capture with promiscuous mode, decoding of ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols, and a thread-safe queue for smooth real-time packet updates in the UI. Designed a color-coded, filterable table for packet summaries and a details pane with parsed headers and payload previews. Added start/stop controls, error reporting, and one-click clearing to create a user-friendly experience. The project emphasizes network protocol parsing, concurrent programming, and GUI development in Python. Future iterations can extend functionality to IPv6 and Pcap export support.


### Proper Form Mobile App
Created a React Native Expo mobile application, Proper Form, that provides users with educational information on exercises, creates and stores routines, provides a nutrition journal, and community engagement around the user’s fitness progress and goals. Proper Form  also incorporates social media with direct messaging features and friends list which can be used to compete on daily steps and exercise challenges. Proper Form is built using React Native, Google Firebase, and an API utilizing the .NET framework and Amazon AWS, including Amazon’s EC2 and RDS database services.


### What to Watch
Developed a React application for the browsing and searching of movies using NextJS and the Movie Database API. The purpose of the application is to allow users to search or discover movies to watch without the results being filtered by search algorithms or region restrictions currently implemented in most streaming services. Furthermore, the application displays not just movies shown on one streaming service but all services to widen the scope and make it easier for users to find a movie to watch. The application features a UI/UX similar to Netflix, and offers a homepage that displays movies based on genre. The user can search by genre or name of movie and discover a library of films both domestic and international. 

### Task Sultan
A SaaS web-based application for teams and individuals to create, assign, and track tasks through customizable workflows, inspired by Jira but focused on simplicity and modern UX. Task Sultan’s front end is React (Typescript) and Material UI giving a scalable, responsive user interface. The backend is NodeJs with prisma with a REST API allowing for the creation, modification, and assignment of workspaces, projects, tasks, and subtasks. 

### Ready for Life
Ready for Life is a React Native mobile application designed to help users set goals, plan daily tasks, track food consumption, and log daily exercise. The application aims to empower users to lead healthier, more organized lives by providing an intuitive and integrated platform for personal development and wellness tracking. The front end of the website is React Native and incorporates Redux and React Navigation, among other packages and features to accomplish the goals of the application. The backend incorporates Google Firebase, including Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase realtime databases.
